We first start with cleaning and getting data ready for preprocessing, the steps we took were -->

we Renamed the files based on year_day_shift.
we then removed the last page as it has the answers to the questions and we are in no need of it.

1. config.py - For Configuration
Create this file to store all your settings. This is much better than hardcoding paths or keys in your main scripts.

2. ocr_extractor.py - The OCR Engine
This file will contain your friend's advanced OCR code. It's responsible for one job: turning a PDF file into raw, extracted text.

3. text_parser.py - The GPT-4o Parser & Structurer
This module will contain your friend's GPT cleaning function. Crucially,
I've also added a function (structure_gpt_output) to take the clean text from GPT and turn it into the final JSON format you need.

4. main.py - Your Main Controller
Finally, main.py will orchestrate the entire process. It imports functions from the other modules and runs them in order.
This is the only file you'll need to run.
